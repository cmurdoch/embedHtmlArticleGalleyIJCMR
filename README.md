## Description
This OJS plugin provides rendering support for HTML Article Galleys and supports iPads. Instead of iframes, the plugin fetches the content of a HTML file and embeds it to the page.

The plugin also displays the journal's header and footer for consistent branding across a journal's website. Also, it uses the standard OJS breadcrumb instead of the one used in the HtmlArticleGalley plugin.

Compatible with OJS 3.3.0-x
