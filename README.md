# embedHtmlArticleGalleyIJCNR
OJS embedded HTML Article Galley including header and footer adapted for International Journal of Creative Media Research

## Description
This OJS plugin provides rendering support for HTML Article Galleys and supports iPads. Instead of iframes, the plugin fetches the content of a HTML file and embeds it to the page.

The plugin also displays the journal's header and footer for consistent branding across a journal's website. Also, it uses the standard OJS breadcrumb instead of the one used in the HtmlArticleGalley plugin.

Compatible with OJS 3.3.0-x

Based on work [https://github.com/ajnyga/embedHtmlArticleGalley](https://github.com/mpbraendle/embedHtmlArticleGalleyHeader) by @mpbraendle.
